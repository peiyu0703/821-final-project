Project: Attributes include id, name, and a list of tasks.

## Functionality
Add tasks: Users can create tasks, specifying their details.

Edit tasks: Users can modify task details.

List tasks: Display all tasks or filter them based on criteria (e.g., by project, status).

Mark tasks as completed: Update the status of tasks.

Organize tasks into projects: Assign tasks to projects or move them between projects.

Add/Edit projects: Create or modify projects.

View projects: List all projects and their associated tasks.

## CLI Interface
